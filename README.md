# Self-Assessment-for-Final-Project

## Self Assessment:
### Throughout the six-month boot camp, we learned many data analytics skills and tools. The goal of this final project is to showcase these tools using a real-world project.  The project is broken into four segments, with each having a deliverable due on a weekly basis. The breakdown of each segment can be found in the "Final_Project_Rubric.pdf" file in the GitHub Repository.  I worked on this project as a database and ETL lead.

## Team Assessment:
### We worked as a team with each member who brought distinctive skills and collaborated during the entire process of project selection, design, and distribution of different roles and responsibilities.  Below is the list of team members and their roles in the project.
###	Presentation lead: Andrew Winkelman/Alexandra Williams 
###	Machine Learning Model lead: Michelle Ewers
### Dashboard lead: Alexandra Williams / Andrew Winkelman
###	Database & ETL lead: Rubina Shrivastava


## Summary of the project:
### - Each member of the group leads a portion of the project. There was a Database Lead, Machine Learning Lead, Dashboard Lead, and Presentation lead.
### - The project was centered around machine learning methods learned in the class. However, in preparation for machine learning, extensive ETL and data pre-processing procedures will be handled.
### - A GitHub Repository has been created for working files and the final write-up for this project.
### - All team membersâ€™ code was commented on and organized within the GitHub repository.
### - The GitHub ReadMe will include a detailed walk-through of the steps taken throughout this project. It will include information on the ETL process, descriptions of the machine learning methods used, and links to both the dashboard and final presentation.
### - The group is creating a presentation that will be showcased during the last class (on November 17th, 2022). 
### - The project will include a database that uses various sources to gather information in one location. The sources will be listed in the GitHub ReadMe.
### - The database is hosted in the Azure SQL on Azure cloud so that all members can access it for both the machine learning process and the dashboard creation. 
### - The database will require at least one connection string, one join, and at least two tables. 
### - For the machine learning model, the following has been provided: a description of data pre-processing, feature engineering and selection, decision-making process, model choice, and final accuracy score.
### The dashboard on Tableau and HTML has one interactive element, along with data from the database. -The final presentation will be hosted on Google Slides and linked to the GitHub repository.
